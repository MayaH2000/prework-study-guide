# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I made this project to become more familiar with and therefore better at, coding! My motivation is to be able to become well organized with coding and web development so that I can one day make a career out of it! It includes problem solving, such as debugging my own work, the work of others, and being able to find solutions within webpages. I so far have learned how to format CSS, HTML, and Javascript!
